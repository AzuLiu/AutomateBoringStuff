#Python编程快速上手 让繁琐工作自动化 

Automate boring stuff with Python.

Theses codes are written in the process of learning this book.

It not onliy includes most practice from this book and but aslo some intereting stuff I made up with.

I have to say it's a great book to start to code.

You can learn very usfeul and pratical skills to solve automatic problems in your office, such as excell,pdf,word,email,etc.

But it also has a big disadvantage that it's too simple so that it just tells you how to do withou expilicit explanation.

As I say, it's just a start!

Anyway,welcome to the code world!

You will love it!
