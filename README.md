#Python编程快速上手 让繁琐工作自动化 

Automate boring stuff with Python.

This is my first book about coding.

Theses codes are written in the process of learning this book.

It not only includes most practice from this book and but aslo some interesting stuff I made up with.

I am sorry for the mess of my code, I don't realize that I will upload my file to my github when I was writing this.

I have to say it's a great book to start to code.

You can learn very useful and pratical skills to solve automatic problems in your office, such as excel,pdf,word,email,etc.

But it also has a big disadvantage that it's too simple so that it just tells you how to do without expilicit explaination.

As I say, it's just a start!

Anyway,welcome to the code world!

You will love it!
